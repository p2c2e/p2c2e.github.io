After a *long* hiatus, I recently decided to follow developments on the technology front. Most of my recent work had not given me either the time nor the need to do this.

For starters, I figured I would not want to mess with our family's shared desktop and buy myself a new laptop (What better excuse could I come up with?).

Choice of laptops:

## Basic specifications 
i5+, 8G+, 500G+ - without Windows preferably (to keep the costs low). No point paying for Windows and then instlling Limux anyway.
## Brands considered 

Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer 
These brands were listed on ease of availability in India/locally, cost, non-windows options and finally my prioir experience with them.
Acer: We could get an i7 at the cost of i5 from the rest of the brands. Cons: Lack of availability and pre-sales response - imagine what would happen after getting stuck with them!
Lenovo: Pros: I still think of them as ThinkPad. Cons: Cost and the feedback on build quality + service in recent times
Asus: Pros: Hardware and in some cases, the build Cons: Availability in India + servicing (my most recent laptop was an Asus bought in US and I had issues trying to upgrde the RAM)
Dell: Pros: Prior exp (my desktop is 8 yrs old - it was bleeding edge when I bought it. Now, other thn the motherboard everything is changed. It still keeps chugging on...)
      Cons: Cost - Compared to Acers of the world. Though they technically have Ubuntu versions in the line-up, none are available easily (really sad to see this).

## Decision:
	 Went with the Dell due to sweet spot of price, availability and prior experience.
	 Dell 5558 - i5 - 15" - non-HD version w/ Windows 8.1

## Prepping the machine:
	 Since I had paid the Windows tax, I might as well ensure that I case use it if required. So, first step was to complete the install and activate 8.1
	 Next: Upgrade to Windows 10 while the free-upgrade offer exists
	 I wanted to note down the Serial details in case I needed to reinstall. Here are some tips:
		 The serials listed by various tools might all be slightly different. Not sure what is the 'correct' one. I made note of everything once in 8.1 and then once again in Window 10.
		 From what I understand once Windows 10 is activted using "Digital Entitlement", we can re-install Window 10 anytime in the future by just clicking "Skip" in the serial screen. Once the system boots up, it will
   connect to MS servers and reactivate based on some set of system parameters.

## Choice of Linux flavors:
	 I have always been partial to Fedora - I have been using some flavor of RedHat on my personal machines since 1998 (when the my other main option of interest was Slackware - that will give you some perspective)
	 Finally decided to go with one of either Fedora or Limux Mint 
		 While Fedora would have given me bleeding edge stuff and helped me with tinkering, I want to tke this opp to learn something new. With yum given way to dnf, I might as well learn apt-get/aptitude!
		 Linux Mint Cinnamon was the choice
