One of the problems with testing out cloud platforms is, we need to be connected to the net all the time. So, sooner or later, we learn to test using solutions like Vagrant as the cluster provider. Even starting a 2 node cluster takes quite a bit of time using this approach.

Good news is the recent addition of 'Minikube' - a single node cluster to test out simple services, pods and replication controllers. Note that any attempts to scale the services will probably result in 'fit failure on node (minikubevm): PodFitsHostPorts' errors due to it being a 'single-node cluster'.

The minikube code is on [github](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikubehttps://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)

The Getting started guide for kubernetes is [here](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/)

Definitely worth a try.
