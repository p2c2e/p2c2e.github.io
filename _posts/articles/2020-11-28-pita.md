If you are like me, you have been furiously (for whatever reason) typing away much of your life - resulting in pain in the arms, wrist or fingers (Think RSI and Carpal Tunnel etc.). Whether you are a programmer or a “busy” emailer, you will encounter this issue at some point. 

I have tried all remedies - addressing internal (hand, wrist posture, breaks) as well as external (standup desks, ‘ergonomic’ keyboards, mechanical long-travel keyboards, vertical/horizontal/handheld mice) etc. with limited success. This includes being one of the first testers of [Twiddler in late 90s] (https://twiddler.tekgear.com/) and flirting with the [Dvorak layout] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout)

While posture and the like do help - if you are consistent/diligent, it is much easier to buy/install things than change behaviour :)

One of the things I have considered is voice dictation software - this is suitable for typing plain English as well as handling most of the app/window management - but falls way short of what is needed for programming. There is also the social impact of being seen saying things like ‘var a colon bool equals …’ and so on. 

I shudder to think - if someone who is physically able - is finding working in a tech job so hard, how much harder it would be for someone who is visually, physically impaired.. 

Anyways, one of the findings has been that I get forearm issues with use of mice (esp. if they are small for the hand). And I have taken some steps to avoid using them - and thus avoid movement of the hand b/w keyboards and mouse.

If you are using a Mac AND you are a productivity fanatic / have ergonomics issues - you may want to consider the below tips.
